Zomato Restaurant Sales and Partner Performance Analysis (2017-2020)

🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of Zomato's restaurant ecosystem performance between 2017 and 2020. The core objective was to identify the true drivers of profitability and scalability for Zomato's partners, moving beyond traditional metrics like volume.

The analysis confirms a critical insight: Average Order Value (AOV), not sheer volume or customer rating, is the primary predictor of top-tier revenue. The most profitable partners achieve differentiation through strategic pricing and superior operational efficiency. This report establishes strategic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and provides actionable recommendations for Partner Management and Sales teams to boost network profitability and quality.

🎯 Strategic Goal

The goal was to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for Zomato's restaurant ecosystem by analyzing the distribution of total revenue and Average Order Value (AOV) across different segments. The final objective is to provide actionable recommendations aimed at maximizing partner profitability and improving overall network efficiency.

💡 Executive Summary: Core Insights

Our findings challenge the notion that success is simply about high order count. Top-tier revenue is driven by Average Order Value (AOV).

AOV is King: The most profitable restaurants leverage higher price points and maintain superior operational efficiency during peak hours.

The Revenue Engine: The Average rating tier (3.0–4.4) is the commercial sweet spot, commanding the highest total sales and a robust AOV.

Required Shift: Zomato must immediately shift its focus to incentivizing high-AOV partners and implementing rigorous quality controls for low-AOV, high-volume segments to mitigate brand risk and boost network profitability.

📊 Detailed Key Findings

I. Seasonal and Geographic Volatility

Extreme Revenue Seasonality: The platform consistently records its highest performance in the early year (January and March, averaging around ₹97 million), but September consistently marks the lowest revenue trough across the network at ₹55 million. This translates to a 43% revenue drop between the peak and the trough.

AOV Peak Disconnect: The peak AOV occurs in August (₹7,568), which does not correspond to the total monthly revenue peak (January). This suggests August is the month where the highest individual spending occurs, likely driven by specific seasonal offers or demographics.

Revenue Concentration: Sales success is not evenly distributed. The top 10 highest-performing cities account for a disproportionately large share of total sales, with Tirupati leading the network at ₹43 million.

II. Partner Segmentation and Quality Risk

AOV Champions vs. Volume Leaders: Top-performing restaurants reveal two distinct models:

Volume Dominators (e.g., Domino's) lead in total revenue (₹4M) with a functional AOV (₹12K).

AOV Champions (e.g., Biryani House) command an exceptional AOV of ₹99K, demonstrating potential for extreme profitability per order.

Hybrid Cuisine Success: High AOV is predominantly generated by hybrid, multi-cuisine categories (e.g., Café, North Indian). Combining high-volume cuisines with high-AOV items (like beverages or bakery goods) maximizes cart size and revenue (₹1.3 million).

The Average Tier is the Engine: The Average rating tier (3.0–4.4) generates a massive 92% of the total network revenue (₹381M). The "Elite" tier has the lowest AOV and minimal sales volume.

Poor Tier Risk: The Poor tier (<3.0) has a deceptively high AOV (₹8K), meaning high-spending customers are receiving poor service, which creates a significant reputational risk.

III. Critical Operational Failure

Weekend Collapse: Order volume is heavily skewed toward weekdays. The volume on Saturday and Sunday drops to less than 500 orders combined, a 98% drop from the Friday peak (35K orders). This near-total absence of weekend sales signals either a severe data capture failure or a fundamental flaw in the weekend offering.

🛠️ Actionable Recommendations

1. Strategic Partner Management

Implement AOV-Centric Nurturing: Create a dedicated "High-Value Partner" (HVP) tier focusing on partners with AOV potential greater than ₹7,000, offering them preferential support and placement.

Incentivize Hybrid Menus: Launch a program to encourage high-volume partners to add complementary, high-AOV items (e.g., add a 'Bakery' section) to immediately boost Average Order Value across the network.

Mandatory Quality Control: Issue immediate operational improvement notices for the Poor tier (<3.0). Partners failing to improve their rating within a 90-day grace period must be temporarily delisted to protect customer trust and high-value customer retention.

2. Operational and Sales Strategy

Urgent Weekend Audit: Launch an immediate, cross-functional investigation to determine the root cause of the 98% drop in weekend order volume. This is a major failure to capture high-demand, high-revenue periods.

Targeted September Stabilization: Implement an annual, aggressive sales campaign specifically to counteract the 43% revenue trough in September, focusing on deals or exclusive promotions to stabilize Q3 performance.

Resource Focus on Tier-1 Hubs: Assign dedicated senior Account Managers to top-performing cities, starting with Tirupati, to prevent churn and protect the most concentrated sources of network sales revenue.
