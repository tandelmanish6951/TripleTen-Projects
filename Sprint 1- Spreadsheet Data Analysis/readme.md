##  Data Cleaning Steps  

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Excel functions and formulas.  

1. **Neighborhood Standardization**  
   - Cleaned inconsistent capitalization and removed trailing spaces.  
   - Created a new column: `neighborhood_clean`.  

2. **Bedrooms Cleaning**  
   - Replaced empty bedroom cells (representing studios) with `0`.  
   - Created a new column: `bedrooms_clean` using the `IF()` function.  

3. **Top Listing Identification**  
   - Created a new column `top_listing` in the listings dataset.  
   - Value = `1` if the listing belongs to the top 10 neighborhoods and matches the most popular property size; otherwise, `0`.  

4. **Revenue Calculation**
